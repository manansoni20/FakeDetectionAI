Project: Fake Detection AI

Project Summary:
A project that detects fake posts by analyzing both text and images using AI. 
The system uses a TextEncoder for text, an ImageEncoder for images, and a Fusion model 
to combine them to predict whether a post is Real or Fake.

Tech Stack:
Python, PyTorch, Torchvision, Pandas, Pillow

Features Implemented:
- TextEncoder implemented and working
- ImageEncoder implemented and working
- Fusion model combines embeddings and gives predictions
- CSV-based data input and output
- Demo successfully predicts fake/real posts with confidence scores

Sample Outputs:
Text: Breaking news: AI is taking over!
Image Path: data/images/img1.jpg
Prediction: Real (confidence: 0.60)

Text: Funny cat memes
Image Path: data/images/img2.jpg
Prediction: Real (confidence: 0.58)

Text: Fake news alert
Image Path: data/images/img3.jpg
Prediction: Real (confidence: 0.62)

Next Steps:
- Train models on larger real datasets to improve accuracy
- Handle more posts efficiently
- Add interactive input or web UI
- Possibly deploy as a small app or web service
